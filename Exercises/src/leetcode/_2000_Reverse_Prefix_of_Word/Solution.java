/**
 * 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word
 * Easy
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Hint
 * Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.
 *
 * For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
 * Return the resulting string.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
 * Output: "dcbaefd"
 * Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3.
 * Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
 * Output: "zxyxxe"
 * Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
 * Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
 * Output: "abcd"
 * Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
 * You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= word.length <= 250
 * word consists of lowercase English letters.
 * ch is a lowercase English letter.
